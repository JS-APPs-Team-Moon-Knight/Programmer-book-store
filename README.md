## Project Description

### Programmer bookstore

We designed and implemented an object-oriented web __SPA__. Our project is a page with the goal of providing a user experience similar to that of a bookstore desktop application. All necessary code – __HTML5__, __JavaScript__, and __CSS3__ – is retrieved with a single page load.
Programmer bookstore was developed with __jQuery__, __Handlebars__, __Navigo__ and __Twitter Bootstrap__ for our UI design. We implemented __OOP design__ as our application logic using objects, modules, and __ES2015__ classes. It uses web data storage - backend with __Kinvey REST API__ and __localStorage__. Our SPA uses third-party API to share a book to Facebook.

* Used __GIT__ as source control system. 
* Hosted on __Heroku__: <a href="https://programmer-bookstore.herokuapp.com/">Programmer bookstore</a>


The application is a specific store for programmers. The users can find the best resources for learning and development of new skills such as books and latest courses for each programming language. 
The SPA have navigation Home/Books/Courses/About/Contacts. Every user can have a private profile by Sign Up - Log in/Log out functionality. Have the option to research, add do cart and buy books. If the user like some book, can share it on Facebook. The APP provide an option to have access to the most popular sites for online programmer courses like Pluralsight, Codeschool etc. Our application uses third-party API to Share status to Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, etc...
